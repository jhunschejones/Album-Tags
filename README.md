# Album Tags

## Objective
I have been a musician and music fan for many years. For one reason or another, I've always preferred to approach an album or an EP as a single unit of art, rather than 6-12+ individual pieces of art. As streaming music services started to grow in popularity, I found that much of their functionality was geared towards songs; playlists, favorites, sharing, etc. This left me without a consistent way to keep track of all the great new records I now had access to through services like Apple Music. I found myself starting to 'discover' albums while researching that were already be saved in my music library.

My goal with Album Tags was to build a user-friendly web app that would allow people like me to access up-to-date music data from Apple Music and curate custom tags, connections, and album lists. I wanted an app where users could search for music by album or artist, view album details, search by the tags associated with one album, or see all user tags at once and search by any tag combination. The end goal of the app has always been to provide new ways to connect music together so that it becomes much harder to lose a great record and much easier to share the music we love with our friends.

## Steps Taken
Album Tags has evolved significantly over the past year. It now allows users to create their own tags, view tags other users have created, and search by any combination of tags. The site's album list functionality allows users to curate and share unlimited lists of albums which can be filtered by artist, year, or custom genres. Finally, for those times when it's hard to put feelings into words, users can manually connect two albums together using the *album connection* functionality.

## Outcome
Click [here](https://www.albumtags.com/) to view with the current production release of Album Tags. I use it every day to keep track of my personal music library and I'm really proud of how it has grown over the past year. Along the way I learned so much more than I ever thought I would and I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work and collaborate with many creative users and new friends. I plan to continue to maintain and improve this app as issues arise and as more features are needed.
